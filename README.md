We demonstrate how to deploy to simple command line apps using uvx.

## Install pipx

The current way to deploy apps is to use [uvx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/).
The tool creates a temporary virtual environment for each app.

For the installation of uv/uvx please refer to the [uvx documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

## Install cvxcli with uvx

cvxcli has been deployed to PyPI like any other Python package. It could be
installed via pip but we advise against that.

cvxcli is not exactly a package you should use as a dependency in your own code.
cvxcli is the home for two apps that are meant to be used from the command line.
So please install via pipx

```bash
uvx --from cvxcli weather
```

This command will create a temporary virtual environment for cvxcli and install the package
into that environment.

Please note that you **do need uvx** to be installed on your machine.

## Using the apps
